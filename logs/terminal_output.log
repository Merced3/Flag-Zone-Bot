["ADDED NEW CODE": 'data_aquisition.py' and 'test_end_of_day_calculation.py', since we had a websocket error i had to change/fix some code, referenced a variable in ws_connect_V2 before assigning it. it didn't output todays end of day message so i had to use the 2nd script i named in this to help with that. instead of using strictly "calculate_day_performance()" i used "reseting_values()" because i needed not only for it to send 2min chart but also end of day calculations and files plus reset values and that function did it all, so i used it in that script.]
