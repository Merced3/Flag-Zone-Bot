there was a order i had at the beginning of today that hit 20% but never finished 
completion of order because of sometype of error im still not aware of. It bought 
at 0.41 and im guessing it would have stopped out at 0.35, thats worse case senario 
because it chopped around it's 20% profit mark. so i editted the end of day 
calculations because of the error not correctly showing todays results, the end of 
day calcualtion was fruit of the poisonous tree. but the later 2 trades were correct 
trades since it was off of another zone and we only needed 13 ema calculations and 
more than 13 candles populated the screen by the time the 2 order were to come about.
