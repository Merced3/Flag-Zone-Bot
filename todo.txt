Currently working on everything display-wise

Everything the new storage system works, just need to get the display/frontend to read whats in the storage via the new stored procedures functionality. The unit tests will show everything storage working.

NEXT THING TO WORK ON:
[x] The zones chart "displays" the zones but not there starting points nor there correct color. that needs to be fixed. The zones chart should be done after that point.
[x] After that we need to work on the live chart, because they don't display zones, levels, emas, flags, nothing... they only currently display candles but we want everything else.
[ ] basics of frontend Chart(s) is finished and ready to commit. Just gotta merge these changes from this branch to main ONCE we committed all the changes to this individual branch `webdash/parquet-live`
