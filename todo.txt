Currently working on everything display-wise

Everything the new storage system works, just need to get the display/frontend to read whats in the storage via the new stored procedures functionality. The unit tests will show everything storage working.

NEXT THING TO WORK ON:
[x] frontend works enough, the objects display.
[ ] Get the historical chart PNG file to show what we see on web_dash.
[ ] Get the EMA's to work with the live chart
