# Temporal Lattice Leap Trading Strategy
## Overview
**Temporal Lattice Leap** is a structured trading strategy that leverages dual-time-frame analysis to guide trading decisions in stocks or options markets. This strategy is tailored for traders who prioritize systematic observation and timing in their trading approach.

## Strategy Description
### Time-Frame Utilization
**Temporal Aspect:** The strategy employs two distinct time frames on price charts: a primary chart updating every 15 minutes and a secondary chart with 2-minute intervals.
**Objective:** To blend the macroscopic view (15-minute chart) with microscopic precision (2-minute chart) for informed trading decisions.

### Price Zone Identification
**Lattice Formation:** Utilizes the 15-minute chart to identify key supply and demand zones.
**Method:** Boxes are drawn around the highest and lowest price points from previous trading days, creating 'lattices' that highlight significant market reactions and potential future price movement areas.

### Entry and Exit Points
**Leap Trigger:** The 2-minute chart is used to pinpoint precise entry points based on price movements breaking out of the identified lattice zones.
**Entry Signal:** A buy (call) or sell (put) decision is made when the price moves distinctly above or below these zones.
**Profit Management:** A portion of the position is sold at a 20% profit to ensure gains, while the remainder (runner) is held for potential further upside.
**Exit Criteria:** The runner position is closed if the price crosses the 13 EMA line, indicating a potential shift in market momentum.

### Ideal User Profile
**Temporal Lattice Leap** is best suited for traders who are adept at interpreting chart patterns and who can make swift decisions based on real-time market data. It requires an active management style and a keen understanding of market dynamics.
