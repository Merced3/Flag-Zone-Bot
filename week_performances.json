I change account back to original account balance because of that. I later figured out that if you buy to high above the 13 ema then it looks like you chased the trade, I implemented a new rule that sees if were close enough to the 13 ema, if were not then we don't authorise the order. a bunch of incorrect orders later, alot learned and fixed but flagging issue is still there. Had a order last to end of day and never had that happened aka never tested that so I need to somehow fix that.",
